        <p class="project-page-overview">
            In the context of a transformation project for the production department, the project team I was part of had several missions. One of them was the development of a new software for the catalog team. The goal was to solve
            the efficiency problems that the catalog team experienced with their software.

                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>
                        The role of the catalog team is to create and update product data on the CMS. Their mission includes working on product descriptions, categorizations,
                        visuals. In this regard it is crucial for the catalog team to be able to create and update product data swiftly.

                <div class="phase">
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Originally, the catalog team worked directly on our CMS. This proved to be inneficient on multiple levels: some steps were too technical or redundant.
                        Additionally, working directly on the CMS meant that the team had to go through steps that weren't directly related to their line of work, which was a problem in terms of workflow. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="phase">
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        We wanted to streamline the catalog team process by developing a software tailored to their needs. The idea was to create a tool that would only contain the features
                        related to their line of work. The software improved the catalog team workflow by being decoupled from the CMS and sending it product data through API requests. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="phase">
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        I spent time with the catalog team to understand their end-to-end process, with shadowing sessions and workshops.
                        After we modeled the current and target processes, we iterated over prototypes and organized testing sessions to validate our designs against the business cases we documented.
