            Proof of concept for an automated system extracting invoice data from mail attachments using computer vision,

                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>
                        Invoices are key documents in most business activities such as inventory management or customer relationship.
                        The data they contain can be crucial to monitor commercial performance alongside other metrics.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>
                        Usually, invoices take the form of pdf files which are not considered "structured" data-wise: 
                        it can be a challenge to leverage invoice data for analysis purposes as it would require extracting said data beforehand, 
                        costing time and effort when the extraction is done manually. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="phase">
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        When a company has a dedicated mail address for invoices (e.g. invoice@mycompany.com), it can be beneficial to set up a system that automatically extracts invoice data from new mails. 
                        Extracted data can then be added to a database, Sharepoint list or Google Sheet for further analysis by business teams. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="phase">
                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        Developing this system was done in two parts: it required the creation of an API to process the invoice file and extract data.
                        Once the API was set, a function was created in Google App Scripts to send a request to the API based on a time trigger.
